# $whoami

Hello

I am a software and security enthusiast currently pursuing graduate studies at UMD-College Park. Especially love anything related to software development security.

I have also worked as a software engineer at VMware and Versa Networks. I am also interested in operating systems and anything low-level and a part-time ctfer who is focused on pwn and reversing.
Other than computers, loves football, jazz and funk. Feel free to DM for a hello: [twitter](https://twitter.com/z3phyrrrrr)
