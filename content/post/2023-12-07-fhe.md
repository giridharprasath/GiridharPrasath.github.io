# Fully homomorphic encryption

## Introduction

The blog post tries to explain the idea of fully homomorphic encryption, Consider two messages $m1,\ m2$ being stored in a public cloud or a datacenter. Let the encrypted ciphertext which are stored there be $c1 = enc_k(m1), c2 = enc_k(m2)$, and now if we have to perform an operation(say concat these messages), we need to decrypt the entire message m1 and m2 and encrypt them again at store, there is a possibilty of plaintext leakage during this operation.

FHE allows you to calculate the encrypted ciphertext say $c'$ without needing to decrypt $m1, \ m2$, Hence for the operator $\oplus$

$$\begin{align*} \text{enc}{\text{pk}}(m_1)\ {\oplus}\ \text{enc}{\text{pk}}(m_2) &= \text{enc}{\text{pk}}(m_1\ {+}\ m_2) \end{align*}$$


In other words, FHE allows computations to be performed on a ciphertext without needing to decrypt it. Applications of FHE can be in block chain, cloud security and federal agencies/government orgs which needs to perform their own computations without compromising the privacy. Let's start with an example.

## Setup

Now we have gained some intro on FHE, let's try to look at an example and deduce the computations.
We will be going through an example from [OpenFHE](https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-development) which is actively developed and supports schemes that include BGV, CKKS, BFV, FHEW, TFHE and CKKS bootstrapping

The setup [doc](https://openfhe-development.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sphinx_rsts/intro/editor_setup.html) is pretty much self-explanatory and would suggest [this](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools) extension for debugging the binaries.

This is the only addition required in `c_cpp_properties.json` to get it running:
```text
            "includePath": [
                "/usr/local/include/openfhe",
                "${workspaceFolder}/**"
            ],
```

## 

Let's take the [example]() of integer arithmetic homomorphic operations using BFV scheme:

BFV is constructed based on RLWE(Ring learning with errors) and operates on ciphertext and plaintext ring. It is computationally hard to solve even for quantum computers.

### Data Representation:

The plaintext and ciphertext spaces are defined over two distinct polynomial rings where $ P \ = R_t $ and $ C \ = R_q \times R_q $ and $t, q \in \mathbb{Z} $.

There are several parameters required for the keygen and encryption of the BFV:
    
- Key and Error distributions - $D1, D2$

- Ring $R$ and modulus $q$

- Integer modulus for the plaintext $P$

Before encrypting the message $m$, we need to turn it into a polynomial,
for example if we want to encrypt $(5(101))$, the representation would be
$1 * x^2 + 0 * x^1 + 1 = x^2 + 1$

### Key generation:

Generating this private key is straightforward. We essentially use random small coefficients from the dostribution $D1,

The public key consists of two elements $A$ and $t$. $A$ is a random polynomial from the distribution $D1$ and for computing $t$ we need to do a matrix operation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
t = As + e
\end{aligned}
$$

where $e$ is the small error vector from the distribution d2.

Secret key: $s$

Public key: $(t, A)$

### Encryption:

Encrypt($m$):

  1) Randomly choose $ u \leftarrow D1 \\ $

  2) Randomly choose noise $ e1, e2 \leftarrow D2 \\ $


  3) Compute the ciphertext:
  $ c[0]=[pk[0]*u+e1+$ $ \delta *m] q, \\ c[1]=[pk[1]*u+ $ e_{2} $ ]q $

The parameter $\delta $ is the quotient of $q \div t $, which is used to scale the message, these values can be modified as the part of generating cryptocontext.


### Decryption:

Decrypt($c$):

  1) Compute:$ tmp \ = [c[0]+c[1]*s]q $

  2) Compute the message: $ m = [(round(tmp*t/q) t.[x] $. t is used to calculate the congruence of $ x\ mod\ q $ in set $ \mathbb{Z} $

Proof of decryption:

$$
\begin{align}
    c[0]+c[1]\cdot{s}\  =\  &pk[0] \cdot u + e1 + \delta {m} + (pk[1]\cdot u + e2)\cdot {s}&\\\\
    &= -(a\cdot {s}+e)\cdot u+e1+\delta {m} + a\cdot u \cdot {s} + e2\cdot \textsf{SK} \nonumber\\\\
    &= {-a\cdot u \cdot {s}} - e\cdot u+e1+\delta {m} + {a\cdot u \cdot {s}} + e2\cdot {s} \nonumber\\\\
    &= \delta {m} - e\cdot u + e1 + e2\cdot{s} \nonumber\\\\
    &= \delta {m} + v \nonumber\\\\
\end{align}
$$

where $s, e1, e2, sk$ are all small vectors.
